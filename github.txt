// how to ignore files from a repository?
// github has a limit to add 100mb per repository   
// so we need to ignore some files to avoid this limit
// we can ignore files by adding them to the .gitignore file
// this file is used by git to ignore files and directories
// we can add a pattern to ignore all files with a certain extension
// for example,:// ignore all files with the .mp3 extension
// we can add the following line to the .gitignore file
// *.mp3
// this will ignore all files with the .mp3 extension
// we can also ignore specific files by adding their names to the .gitignore file
// for example,:// ignore the file named "example.mp3"
// we can add the following line to the .gitignore file
// example.mp3
// this will ignore the file named "example.mp3"
// we can also ignore directories by adding their names to the .gitignore file
// for example,:// ignore the directory named "music"
// we can add the following line to the .gitignore file
// music/
// this will ignore the directory named "music"
// we can also ignore subdirectories by adding their names to the .gitignore file
// for example,:// ignore the subdirectory named "music/subdir"
// we can add the following line to the .gitignore file
// music/subdir/
// this will ignore the subdirectory named "music/subdir"
// we can also ignore files and directories by using a wildcard
// for example,:// ignore all files and directories that start with the name "example"
// we can add the following line to the .gitignore file
// example*
// this will ignore all files and directories that start with the name "example"
// we can also ignore files and directories by using a regular expression
// for example,:// ignore all files and directories that match the regular expression "example.*"
// we can add the following line to the .gitignore file
// example.*
// this will ignore all files and directories that match the regular expression "example.*"
// we can also ignore files and directories by using a glob pattern
// for example,:// ignore all files and directories that match the glob pattern "example/*"
// we can add the following line to the .gitignore file
// example/*
// this will ignore all files and directories that match the glob pattern "example/*"
// we can also ignore files and directories by using a glob pattern with a wildcard
// for example,:// ignore all files and directories that match the glob pattern "example/*.*"
// we can add the following line to the .gitignore file
// example/**
// this will ignore all files and directories that match the glob pattern "example/**"
// we can also ignore files and directories by using a glob pattern with a wildcard and a regular expression
// for example,:// ignore all files and directories that match the glob pattern "example/*.*"
// we can add the following line to the .gitignore file
// example/**
// this will ignore all files and directories that match the glob pattern "example/**"
